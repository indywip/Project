# Class Schedule

## A student's weekly class schedule

This application aims to help students keep track of their classes for each day 
of the week by being able to list the classes they will have in each 
particular day. This application is for students who take many classes per 
week and helps them remember what classes they have each day. This 
project is of interest to me because as a student, I have difficulty 
remembering all the classes I need to attend per day and this application
would ensure that I don't miss any of my classes. 

**User stories:**

- As a user, I want to be able to add or remove multiple classes from my weekly schedule at the same time
